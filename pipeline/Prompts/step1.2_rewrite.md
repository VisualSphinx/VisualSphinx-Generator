You will be translating a Chinese explanation of a vision logic puzzle into English while making certain modifications.

Follow these steps to complete the task:

1. Carefully read and understand the entire Chinese explanation.

2. Translate the explanation from Chinese to English, ensuring that you capture the full meaning and logical relationships present in the original text.

3. As you translate, remove any statements that indicate the answer to the puzzle.

4. Remove phrases like "如下图所示" (as shown in the following figure) or any similar references to figures or images. When you remove these phrases, make sure to maintain the original meaning of the statement. For example, if the original text says "如下图所示，有三个圆圈" (as shown in the following figure, there are three circles), your translation should simply state "There are three circles."

5. Ensure that you fully understand the logical flow and reasoning of the explanation before finalizing your translation. The goal is to provide a clear, coherent explanation in English that preserves the puzzle's logic without giving away the answer or referring to non-existent figures.

6. Write your final translated and modified explanation in English inside <translated_explanation> tags.

Remember, the key is to provide a faithful translation that maintains the puzzle's logic and difficulty while removing direct answer indicators and references to figures.

For example 1, the text you are going to translate is:
<chinese_explanation>
元素组成不同，且⽆明显属性规律，考虑数量规律。九宫格第⼆⾏出现单独的直线，考虑数直线，但整体数 直线没有规律，考虑线的细化考法，即线的⽅向，如下图所示，第⼀⾏图⼀有1组平⾏线，图⼆有2组平⾏ 线，图三有3组平⾏线，第⼆⾏也满⾜此规律，第三⾏前两个图也符合规律，故问号处应该有3组平⾏线，只 有D项符合。 故正确答案为D。
</chinese_explanation>

Then your output is:
<translated_explanation>
The elements have different compositions with no obvious attribute patterns, so consider quantity patterns. In the second row of the grid, a single line appears. Consider counting lines, but the overall line count lacks a clear pattern. Consider a more refined approach by examining line directions. In the first row, the first image has 1 group of parallel lines, the second image has 2 groups of parallel lines, and the third image has 3 groups of parallel lines. The second row follows a similar pattern, and the first two images in the third row also conform to this pattern. Therefore, the question mark location should follow this progression of parallel line groups.

For example 2, the text you are going to translate is:
<chinese_explanation>
元素组成相似，既考查了黑白叠加，还考查了去同存异。这个九宫格图形中第一行和第三行都是前两幅图叠加在 一起得到第三幅图。颜色叠加规律就是：白＋黑＝白，黑＋白＝黑，白＋白＝黑，黑＋黑=白。圆球上部线的规 律是去同存异。此题目的难点是“白＋黑”不等于“黑＋白”，需要注意。 故正确答案为A。
</chinese_explanation>

Then your output is:
<translated_explanation>
The elements have similar compositions, examining both black and white overlays and the concept of preserving differences while removing similarities. In this grid, the first and third rows show the first two images combining to create the third image. The color overlay rule is: white + black = white, black + white = black, white + white = black, black + black = white. The rule for the upper line of the spherical shape is the elimination of the same and retention of the different. The difficulty of this question is that "white + black" does not equal "black + white", and attention should be paid to this.
